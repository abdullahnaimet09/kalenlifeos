              There's no stress, no confusion, no endless scrolling to figure out what matters. Your Adventure Zone activates, showing you the exact tasks that move your goals forward—and every action you take earns you XP, streaks, and rewards.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              You're not forcing motivation - you're enjoying the process, like playing a game where every step is aligned with your bigger purpose. Your habits feel natural, your identity is evolving, and you feel proud - not overwhelmed. You're not just busy - you're building the life you actually want.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              You sit with your family for a slow, intentional meal. You're not just eating—you're making memories. You know their likes, their stories, and what lights them up because your Family Pillar helps you love them better.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              With your Social Circle, you're not just texting random people - you're building deep, real friendships. You know who energizes you, who to invest in, and you plan hangouts, game nights, café meetups, or even short trips that bring you joy.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              Then your Finance Pillar gives you full control. You know how much you earned this week, where your money went, which clients still owe you, and what goals you're saving for. You stop leaking cash and start building wealth - personally and in business.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              Your Health Pillar keeps your body and mind sharp. You track your workouts, diet, sleep. Whether you're lifting weights, walking with your dad, or meal prepping, you're staying consistent without burnout.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              Your Travel Pillar holds your dream destinations and your real trip plans - everything from visa checklists to packing lists - so travel becomes smooth, exciting, and memory-rich, not last-minute stress.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              Your Home & Household is calm and under control. From the bathroom to the bedroom, everything is stocked, clean, and peaceful. No missing toothpaste, no messy laundry, no broken taps - your environment helps you feel focused and relaxed.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              Your brain stays active through the Mind Expansion Pillar. You're not consuming random content anymore - you're learning with direction. Whether it's psychology, design, or code, you track your time, progress, and skill level.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              You connect it to your projects and see how you're getting smarter over time. Then comes joy - your Entertainment Pillar helps you enjoy life. Every movie, show, music, or game is logged. You remember what you loved, explore what excites you, and unwind with intention. It's not mindless - it's soulful.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              Now you're in creation mode. Inside the Content OS, your ideas are flowing. You're not stuck in writer's block - you're posting consistently, building your brand, and tracking every piece from idea to impact.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              The Freelancing OS helps you manage clients, projects, deliver work, and get paid - all in one smooth system. You don't miss deadlines. You don't forget invoices. You feel in control and confident.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              And when it's time to build something big, your Product OS helps you take an idea, validate it, design it, and launch it - step by step. You're not stuck in your head - you're shipping real things that solve real problems.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              Life Insights Dashboard shows you how you're doing in health, habits, work and across all the life pillars - all laid out in simple charts and graphs. You don't have to scroll or search. You just see it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              The Life Pulse Dashboard shows you exactly what's working, what's slipping, and where your energy is going. You notice if you're balanced or if one part of your life is taking over.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              You spot patterns in your habits, progress in your projects, and trends in your behavior. It's like having a mirror for your life, helping you adjust your actions and stay fully aligned with your purpose - without overthinking.
            </p>
